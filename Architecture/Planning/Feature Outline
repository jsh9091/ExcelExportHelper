Idea:
I would like a library that I can use to export data to an Excel worksheet quickly without needing to get into the implementation details of Apache POI in the program using this library. 

Name:
ExcelExportHelper

Technologies:
Java, Apache POI

JIRA:

Stories;
----------------------
Summary: 
Set File Name

Description: 
As a user, I would like an API that can set a file name for the Excel file to be exported, so that I can create a new excel file. 

Acceptance Criteria:
There is an API to set the file name. 
The file name is an absolute file path. (not sure if this makes sense)
If the file name is greater than 31 characters, then the file name is truncated. 
The specified directory location is writable. 
If the specified directory location is not writable, then an exception is thrown.

----------------------
Summary: 
Set Sheet Cell Data

Description:
As a user, I would like an API that set data for an Excel worksheet. 

Acceptance Criteria:
Provides a sheet object to the code using the library to be populated with user data.
The sheet object has an API that is a list of list of strings for the user to fill with cell data.

----------------------
Summary: 
Create a Sheet

Description:
As a user, I would like to be able to create a work sheet and set its name.

Acceptance Criteria:
There is an API to create a sheet that takes a name for the sheet.
The sheet object contains an API to create a sheet and set the name of the sheet. 
If the sheet name contains illegal characters, then an exception is thrown. 

----------------------
Summary: 
Set Column Headers

Description:
As a user, I would like to be able to set column headers, if any are needed. 

Acceptance Criteria:
There is an API to set column headers on the sheet.
The data is stored in a list of strings. 
If the column header list is empty, then no headers are set on the worksheet.
Column headers are set in a bold font.

----------------------
Summary: 
Write File

Description:
As a user, I would like an API to perform the file writing after the data is set. 

Acceptance Criteria:
There is an API to trigger the file writing operations.
An Excel file is generated and can be opened in MS Excel.
If sheet names have identical names, then the subsequent identical names are appended with a trailing incrementing number.
If the user attempts to write a workbook to a file with no sheets in the workbook, then an exception is thrown.

Comments:
Must be done after set file name.
Must be done before setting sheet cell data and header stories.

Summary: 
Set Numerical Data as Numbers

Description:
As a user, I would like cell data to be parsed to numbers where able. 

Acceptance Criteria:
Cells that appear to contain numbers are parsed to integers or doubles and set as a number in the cell.

Summary: 
Parse Hyperlinks

Description:
As a user, if the provided contents of a cell is a string of plain text is a parsable URL, then I would like that URL to set as a hyperlink within the cell.

Acceptance Criteria:
A cell of text that is a web address is set as a hyperlink in the cell.

----------------------
Summary: 
Sample Code

Description:
As a user, I would like to see some sample code that demonstrates the use of the EEH in practice. 

Acceptance Criteria:
Sample code exists that demonstrates the core feature set of the EEH.
